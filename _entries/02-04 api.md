The `rating-api` is a NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB to retrieve and rate items. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `rating-api` on GitHub: <https://github.com/RH-HKG-ROSA-Workshop/rating-api>
- The container exposes port 8080
- MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI`


### Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-api`

> **Note** You're going to be using [source-to-image (S2I)](#source-to-image-s2i) as a build strategy.

{% collapsible %}

We'll now deploy the `rating-api` app. **Don't miss the entry in the following command where we need you to add your GitHub username**.

```sh
oc new-app https://github.com/RH-HKG-ROSA-Workshop/rating-api --strategy=source
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

First we'll need to get to the correct screen. Ensure you're in the **Administrator** view, then navigate to **Workloads -> Deployments**, selecting **rating-api**, and move to the **Environment** tab.

We can now create the environment variable using the NAME `MONGODB_URI`. The VALUE should look like `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`. You'll need to replace the `[username]` and `[password]` with the ones you used when creating the database. You'll also need to replace the `[endpoint]` with the hostname acquired in the previous step.

> **Note** Don't miss replacing your student number in the following VALUE entry. 

The VALUE should look something like this: **mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop<student#>.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb**

Hit **Save** when done.

It can also be done with an OC command.

```
oc set env deploy/rating-api MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop<student#>.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Verify that the service is running

{% collapsible %}

You can navigate to the logs of the `rating-api` deployment by going **Workloads -> Pods** and selecting the  **rating-api** pod that is currently **running**, 

![Navigate to verify mongoDB connection](media/rating-api-navigate.png)

If you move to the **Logs** tab, you should see a log message confirming the code can successfully connect to the MongoDB.

{% endcollapsible %}

### Retrieve `rating-api` service hostname

{% collapsible %}

Find the `rating-api` service.

```sh
oc get svc rating-api
```

Once you replace your student name in the following, the service will be accessible at this DNS name over port 8080: `rating-api.workshop<student#>.svc.cluster.local:8080` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`. This resolves only within the cluster.
