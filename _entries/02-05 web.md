The `rating-web` is a NodeJS application that connects to the `rating-api`. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `rating-web` on GitHub: <https://github.com/RH-ANZ-ROSA-Workshop/rating-web>
- The container exposes port 8080
- The web app connects to the API over the internal cluster DNS, using a proxy through an environment variable named `API`

### Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

### Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-web`

> **Note** You're going to be using [source-to-image (S2I)](#source-to-image-s2i) as a build strategy.

We'll now deploy the `rating-web` app. **Don't miss the entry in the following command where we need you to add your GitHub username**.

```sh
oc new-app nodejs:12~https://github.com/RH-ANZ-Workshops/rating-web --strategy=source
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

Create the `API` environment variable for `rating-web` Deployment. The value of this variable is going to be the hostname/port of the `rating-api` service.

Instead of setting the environment variable through the web console, we'll set it through the OpenShift CLI.

```sh
oc set env deploy/rating-web API=http://rating-api:8080
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Expose the `rating-web` service using a Route

{% collapsible %}

Expose the service.

```sh
oc expose svc/rating-web
```

Find out the created route hostname

```sh
oc get route rating-web
```

You should get a response similar to the below.

![Retrieve the created route](media/oc-get-route.png)

> **Note** Certain browsers are configured to default to HTTPS. Please note that the web app we are creating uses HTTP for simplicity. You may need to manually force the non-secure HTTP usage.
> 
> Please also note that the fully qualified domain name (FQDN) is comprised of the application name and project name by default. The remainder of the FQDN, the subdomain, is your Red Hat OpenShift Service on AWS cluster specific apps subdomain.

You can also retrieve this from the web console by toggling to the **Developer** view, then navigating to **Topology** and selecting the "Open URL" icon at the top right of the Deployment. Alternatively, you can select the rating-web Deployment and find the route in the lower right corner (you may need to scroll down).

### Try the service

{% collapsible %}

Open the hostname in your browser, you should see the rating app page. Play around, submit a few votes and check the leaderboard.
